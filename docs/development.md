# Local Development

The [showcase](https://github.com/back-stack/showcase) repository includes a [devcontainer](https://containers.dev/) configuration to provide all of the necessary tooling for development of the BACK stack. The only prerequisites on your local machine are:

- a container runtime that supports Docker (e.g. [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/))
- a runtime for devcontainer (e.g. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers), [DevPod](https://devpod.sh/), or [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces))
